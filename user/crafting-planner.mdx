title: Crafting Planner

description: Plan crafts with exact material math, quality targets, and shareable plans. Build from any recipe, split inputs, and send results to commissions or marketplace listings.

## Overview
The Crafting Planner lets you pick an item, load its full recipe tree, and fine tune every input until you reach the exact output you want. You can split materials, adjust quantities, target a quality tier, and the calculator keeps the math perfect as you go. Plans can be saved and shared with a link that anyone can view without an account.

## Quick Start

1. Open **Character Menu â†’ Crafting Calculator**  
2. Search and select an item or recipe  
3. Set **Quantity** and, if supported, a **Quality** target  
4. Adjust inputs in the **Recipe Configuration** panel until the desired output is achieved  
5. Save your plan or share it with a public link

## Recipe Builder

When you choose an item, the calculator loads a hierarchical **Recipe Configuration** with every subcomponent.

- Each row shows the **item**, **rarity**, **quantity**, **quality**, and **status**  
- Expand rows to view subcomponents and intermediate materials  
- Inline validation highlights mismatches so you always balance exactly to the target output  
- Collapsed and expanded totals give you both a quick snapshot and a detailed breakdown

### Splits and Exact Math
You can split inputs across different rarities or sources. The calculator reconciles split quantities against the required total and warns when the split does not match the target. This ensures your plan always crafts to the exact final quantity.

## Quality Targeting

On the right panel you can set or review your **Output Quality**.

- Shows current **Quality score** with a progress indicator to the next tier  
- Displays **Quality Thresholds** per tier such as Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Heroic, Legendary  
- Adjusting input rarities or quantities will update the quality score in real time  
- Add an **Artisan Quality Rating** note to document assumptions for your plan

---

## Inputs

- **Quantity**  
  Final number of items to produce. All subcomponent math scales automatically.

- **Rarity**  
  Choose per material to influence quality thresholds when applicable.

---

## Save and Share

- **Save Plan** to your profile so you can revisit or duplicate later  
- **Share Link** generates a public URL that anyone can view without a VerraLink account  
- Shared views are read only which makes collaboration simple and safe

## Tips

- Use splits to fine tune quality while keeping costs under control  
- Keep an eye on validation messages in the configuration panel to avoid under or over producing subcomponents  
- Pair the calculator with the **Recipe Tracker** and **/recipe** command to see who in your guild can craft the final item

## Notes

- Calculations reflect the current recipe data and your selected prices  
- Quality thresholds and efficiency depend on recipe rules, mastery, and any bonuses you enable  
- If a recipe changes, saved plans will prompt you to refresh before reuse
