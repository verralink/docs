# User Overview

VerraLink is more than a guild management tool. It is built for **all players in Ashes of Creation**, whether you are part of a guild or playing independently.  

As a player, you gain access to features that track your progress, connect you to artisans and traders, and let you interact with guild activities directly through Discord.  

This section introduces the three main user tools:

---

## Character Profiles
Your VerraLink character profile is your identity on the platform. It includes:  
- Marketplace history of items you bought or sold  
- Commission history of services you completed or requested  
- Artisan professions and available services  
- Character level and stats  
- Race, archetypes, and class  

Profiles keep all your data in one place and connect you to guilds, marketplaces, and commissions.

## Public Marketplace
The Public Marketplace connects **all players on VerraLink** in a single trading hub. Unlike the Guild Marketplace, which is limited to guild members, the Public Marketplace creates a server-wide economy where artisans, traders, and adventurers can exchange goods and services freely.  

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to the **Character Menu → Storefront**, then select **Public Marketplace** to open the trading hub  
2. Create a new listing by adding:  
   - The **item name**  
   - A **description**  
   - Optional **image or banner**  
   - Desired **price** in gold or other currencies  
   - Any special notes or trade requirements  
3. Post the listing to make it visible to the entire VerraLink community  
4. Players can browse, purchase, or negotiate trades directly through the marketplace  
5. When you start a transaction, it will appear under **Character Menu → Transactions** where both parties can track progress until completion  

### Features
- **Listings**: Any player can list crafted items, materials, consumables, or services  
- **Economy**: Pricing is entirely player-driven, allowing supply and demand to set value  
- **Transparency**: Every transaction is logged under your **Transactions tab** for easy tracking  
- **Accessibility**: Open to all players, guilded or unguilded, fostering a unified trading environment  

The Public Marketplace is where artisans can showcase their skills, adventurers can sell loot, and every player can participate in Verra’s larger economy.

## Discord Commands
Players can use VerraLink’s Discord integration directly, even outside of their guild server.  

- **`/upload`**: Available in any Discord where the VerraLink bot is present. The bot will DM you to update your character privately using OCR, ensuring your data stays accurate.  
- **Activities Embeds**: When a guild posts an activity, members can react directly in Discord as **Attending**, **Absent**, or **Tentative**. This keeps participation simple and visible.  
- **Commissions Embeds**: Commission posts appear as embeds where you can review the details and click through to make a submission directly.  

These commands and embeds make it easy to stay connected with your guild or the wider community without leaving Discord.
