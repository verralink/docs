title: Loadouts

description: Create recurring statics and role compositions for your guildâ€™s activities. Loadouts make it easy to assign balanced parties and reuse optimized setups.

---

## Overview
Loadouts extend the Activities and Party Management systems by letting officers create **statics**: recurring, pre-defined party structures that can be reused across events.  

Instead of building new groups every time, officers can prepare loadouts in advance and quickly assign members into balanced parties during activities. This ensures consistency, faster preparation, and long-term synergy between the same groups of players.

## Quick Start

1. Go to **Loadouts** under the **Activities** section of your guild dashboard  
2. Create a new **Loadout**  
3. Define the desired party structure  
   - Example: 2 Tanks, 4 DPS, 2 Healers  
   - Example: Guild War party with 1 Tank, 3 DPS, 2 Bards, and 2 Healers  
   - **User-based**: create statics by assigning specific members to each party  
   - **Role-based**: define roles for each party and VerraLink will auto-fill with attendees of the event who match those roles  
4. Save the Loadout for future use  
5. When an upcoming event begins, apply the Loadout from the activity page to quickly assign members into the defined structure  

## Usage

### Role Compositions
- Officers define the ideal party structure by role or class distribution  
- Loadouts can be tailored for raids, sieges, guild wars, or specialized events  
- Patterns include balanced raid parties, static dungeon groups, or PvP-focused teams  

### Statics
- Loadouts allow the creation of **statics**: fixed groups of members that always play together  
- Statics encourage synergy, coordination, and trust between the same set of players  
- Officers can link members directly to roles inside a static to lock compositions  

### Integration with Activities
- Loadouts are tied directly to the **Activities System**  
- When an event is created, officers can instantly apply a Loadout to populate parties  
- Members are assigned based on their roles and previous static assignments  

### Flexibility
- Multiple Loadouts can be created for different event types  
- Officers can edit, duplicate, or retire Loadouts as the guild evolves  
- Loadouts can be adjusted on the fly to handle unexpected attendance changes  

## Notes
- Loadouts are designed to complement Party Management by making group setup faster and more consistent  
- Statics created with Loadouts help build long-term synergy and ensure role coverage across events  
- Officers retain full control to adjust assignments dynamically during activities
