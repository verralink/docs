## Overview
VerraLink connects your guild to Discord so events, attendance, commissions, and marketplace activity stay visible where your community lives. Officers can post activity embeds, take attendance, receive application and transaction alerts, and view quick statistics through slash commands.  

Discord integration is configured in **Guild Settings → Discord, Commissions, Marketplace, Activities**.

- Mirrors the members in your current voice channel and logs them for the selected activity  
- Verifies each member is an active guild member on the website  
- Sends a DM to valid members confirming attendance  
- Sends an access code to the officer by DM for members who attended but were not in voice
