title: Guild Storefront

description: The Guild Marketplace is an internal trading hub where members can buy, sell, and exchange items within their guild, creating a self-sustained economy.

## Overview
The Guild Marketplace provides a private space for guild members to trade exclusively within their community. While the **Global Marketplace** connects all players across Verra, the Guild Marketplace focuses inward, fostering a guild-only economy that supports collaboration, progression, and resource sharing.  

By limiting trade to members, guilds can build a diverse internal economy that encourages teamwork and strengthens their collective goals.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the **Character Menu → Storefront**, then select **Guild Marketplace** to open your guild’s marketplace  
2. Create a new listing by adding:  
   - The **item name**  
   - A **description**  
   - Optional **image or banner**  
   - Desired **price** in gold or DKP  
   - Any special notes or trade requirements  
3. Post the listing to make it visible to guild members  
4. Members can browse, purchase, or negotiate trades directly within the marketplace  
5. When a member starts a transaction with a seller’s item, it will appear as a **notification under the Character Menu → Transactions**, allowing both parties to track the trade until it is completed  
6. Officers can monitor listings and manage activity if needed  

## Usage

### Internal Economy
- Provides a **guild-only marketplace** separate from the global economy  
- Allows guilds to circulate resources internally for progression, crafting, and preparation  
- Encourages members to support one another with fair prices and mutual benefit  

### Listings
- Members can list crafted items, materials, or consumables  
- Listings can use in-game gold, DKP, or other guild-agreed currencies  
- Optional images or banners make posts easier to identify  

### Comparison with Global Marketplace
- **Global Marketplace**: open to all players on VerraLink, designed for wide-scale trade and price discovery  
- **Guild Marketplace**: private to your guild, designed for internal trade, collaboration, and resource circulation  

### Officer Controls
- Officers may oversee listings to prevent abuse or maintain balance  
- Certain guilds may set their own rules for internal pricing or trade practices  

## Notes
- The Guild Marketplace is a complement to the Global Marketplace, not a replacement  
- All trades are tracked through the **Transactions tab** for transparency  
- It strengthens guild identity by creating a **self-sustained economy** inside the guild  
- Officers and members alike benefit from an accessible internal trading hub
