## Overview
The VerraLink bot gives players direct access to their profiles, attendance, and guild activities through Discord. Commands are designed with privacy in mind, with sensitive data delivered by DM.

Embeds for activities and commissions let you react or open submissions without leaving Discord.

## Core Commands

### `/upload`
Updates your character privately via DM.  
- Works in any Discord where the VerraLink bot is present  
- Uses OCR upload to keep your profile accurate without exposing data publicly

### `/characters`
Shows all characters on your VerraLink profile in a private DM.  
- Includes core stats and data  
- Only you can see this information

### `/profile`
Displays the character linked to the current guild server.  
- Requires that you are a member of the guild on VerraLink and that the server is linked

### `/absent`
Submit a leave of absence directly through Discord.  
- Your guild officers will see the absence in their tools and attendance views

### `/ap`
Check your Activity Points instantly.  
- Returns your current AP balance (DM or ephemeral response depending on server settings)

### `/dkp`
Check your Dragon Kill Points instantly.  
- Returns your current DKP balance (DM or ephemeral response depending on server settings)

### `/join`
Allows players to apply to be linked to join a guild directly through Discord.  

- Creates an embed with the guild’s name, description, and banner image  
- Includes an **Apply** button that links users to the VerraLink site to complete their application   
- Keeps recruitment simple and accessible from any server where the bot is present  

This command is essential for guild recruitment and integrates directly with **Guild Discovery** and **Applications**.  

## Attendance Embeds

### Reactions
When a guild posts an activity, the bot creates an attendance embed. You can react to indicate your status.  
- ✅ Attending  
- ❌ Absent  
- ❓ Tentative

### Access Code Button
If you attended an activity but were not present in voice, officers may provide an access code.  
- Use the Access Code button on the attendance embed to enter your code and receive credit

## Commissions Embeds
Guild commissions appear as embeds in Discord.  
- Review commission details at a glance  
- Open the specific commission to submit directly from the embed  
- Track your submission status

## Notes
- Sensitive commands return results in private DMs for security  
- Reactions and buttons on embeds are the fastest way to interact with guild activities  
- The access code system ensures genuine participants receive credit even if they could not join voice
