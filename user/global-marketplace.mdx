title: Global Storefront

description: The Global Marketplace is a public trading hub where all players can buy, sell, and exchange items and services across the entire VerraLink community.

## Overview
The Global Marketplace connects the **entire VerraLink community** into one global trading hub. Unlike the Guild Marketplace, which is limited to members of a single guild, the Global Marketplace is open to all players, creating a diverse economy that spans across Verra.  

This is where artisans, adventurers, and traders come together to post listings, purchase items, and exchange resources on a server-wide scale.

## Quick Start

2. Create a new listing by adding:  
   - The **item name**

   - Optional **image or banner**  
   - Desired **price** in gold

3. Post the listing to make it visible to the entire VerraLink community  
4. Other players can browse your listing, make offers, or purchase directly
