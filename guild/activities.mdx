## Overview
The Activities System is VerraLink’s planned event management tool, designed to help guilds organize, schedule, and track events in a fully customizable way. It serves as the structured counterpart to the Attendance System, making it ideal for planned raids, sieges, and other recurring guild activities.

Every activity is displayed with a **dynamic embed** in Discord that updates in real time to reflect the current state of the event, ensuring members always see the most accurate and up to date information.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the **Activities page** in your guild menu  
2. Create a new activity by defining the name, description, time, DKP rewards, and default voice or text channels  
3. If you want to use templates, go to **Guild Settings → Activities** and make sure the template is set to **All** or **Website** so it can be selected during event creation on the website  
4. Post the activity through the website. As long as Discord channel mappings are enabled, the activity will automatically populate in your community Discord  
5. Members can join the activity via the **website** or directly through the **Discord embed**  
6. The embed updates dynamically as members join and as the activity progresses  

## Usage

### Customizable Event Templates
Officers can fully customize their events with templates, ensuring consistency for recurring content. Templates may include preset times, DKP weights, and designated channels. Templates can be restricted for officer use or made available for general event creation.

### Dynamic Embeds
The activity embed in Discord changes state as the event progresses, showing the most accurate representation of the event at any given time. Members never need to guess whether an event is pending, live, or complete.

### Website and Discord Integration
Members can confirm participation either through the VerraLink website or through the Discord embed integration, offering flexibility and convenience.

### Party Management
Activities integrate directly with **Party Management**, allowing officers to divide attendees into structured groups. This is useful for organizing roles, balancing groups, and managing larger raid compositions.  
- Members can be assigned to specific parties during event setup or on the fly  
- Officers can adjust party structures as needed, ensuring optimal group balance  

### Loadouts
Loadouts work alongside Party Management but are covered in more detail on their own dedicated page. Officers can link Loadouts to parties for better role and gear optimization.

## Notes
- The Activities System is designed for **planned guild events**, complementing the **Attendance System**, which is ideal for spontaneous events.  
- Officers have full control over events, from scheduling to assigning default channels.  
- The dynamic embed ensures members always see up to date event information without refreshing or reposting.
