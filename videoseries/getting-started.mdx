# VerraLink Video Series

## Overview
The **VerraLink Video Series** is a collection of short tutorials designed to help you understand every aspect of the platform. These videos walk you through each major feature — from character setup and marketplace navigation to guild management and Discord integration.

We are releasing these videos progressively to ensure that every user, whether a guild leader or an individual player, can make the most of VerraLink’s functionality.

## Release Schedule
We will be releasing these videos gradually as new systems roll out.  
Each video corresponds directly to a section of the documentation, allowing you to learn visually while exploring the written guides.

Stay tuned to our official YouTube channel and Discord for announcements on new episodes.

## Notes
The goal of this series is to help every VerraLink user understand not only **how** to use each feature but also **why** it matters — empowering guilds and individuals to fully leverage the tools we’ve built for the Verra community.
