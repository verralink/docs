## Overview
Guild Discovery allows officers to showcase their guild publicly on VerraLink. This feature makes it easier for players to find your guild, understand its priorities, and apply for membership. All visibility and recruitment options are controlled by officers.

## Discovery Profile
When enabled, your guild can be displayed in the global guild listings with the following details:  
- **Guild name**  
- **Member size** (optional, can be hidden)  
- **Founding date** (optional, can be hidden)  
- **Description** (your guild’s overview and recruitment pitch)  
- **Priority Classes** (indicate which classes your guild is actively recruiting)  
- **Priority Artisans** (highlight artisan professions you are prioritizing)  
- **Recruitment Status** (enable or disable recruitment at any time)  

Officers have full control over what is displayed and what remains hidden.

## Recruitment Forms
Guild Discovery supports **custom recruitment forms** that officers can design to fit their guild’s needs.  
- Add custom questions to learn more about applicants  
- Collect information on classes, roles, experience, and goals  
- Applicants submit forms directly through the Discovery page  

## Application Management
- Applications are sent directly to your guild’s Discord for review and approval  
- Officers can accept, reject, or request more information from applicants  
- Keep application history organized for reference
