title: Crafting Request System
description: A complete guild crafting workflow that lets members request items, break down materials automatically, and coordinate artisans with full DKP and AP tracking.
---

## Overview
The Crafting Request System allows guild members to request crafted items through a fully structured workflow that integrates with artisans, materials, DKP, and the crafting calculator.  
Every request becomes a coordinated task shared between the requester, officers, and the artisans capable of creating the item.

This system is designed to eliminate confusion, ensure transparency, and centralize every crafting action your guild performs.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Creating a Request
Members can submit a new crafting request from:
- **Guild Dashboard → Crafting Requests** or
- Crafting Calculator save actions

When creating a request, the user selects:
- The **item**  
- Desired **rarity**  
- Quantity  
- Optional **notes or instructions**

The system then pulls the entire recipe tree automatically using the Crafting Calculator.

### 2. Automatic Recipe Breakdown
Once submitted, the system:
- Loads every required material  
- Breaks down subcomponents recursively  
- Shows exact quantities  
- Applies quality thresholds  
- Carries over any splits or rarity inputs from the calculator  

Users and officers can see:
- Total material cost  
- Required components  
- Output quality projection  
- Progress to next rarity tier  

### 3. Approval
Requests enter a **Pending Approval** state.

Officers and staff can:
- Approve or reject requests  
- Modify instructions  
- Tag artisans or assign specialists  
- Adjust DKP/AP reward values  

Once approved, the request becomes active.

### 4. Artisan Fulfillment
Eligible artisans can open the request to:
- Reserve portions of the craft  
- Claim subcomponents  
- Upload finished items  
- Mark steps as complete  

The system supports **multi-artisan collaboration**, allowing large crafts to be split among multiple people.

Artisans can also submit:
- Evidence (screenshots, videos, files)  
- Notes on progress  
- Verification logs  

### 5. Completion
When all materials and subcomponents are fulfilled:
- Officers finalize the request  
- DKP and Activity Points are automatically awarded  
- A completion log is generated  
- The request moves into the **History** tab  

All data can be exported as **Excel** for guild bookkeeping.
