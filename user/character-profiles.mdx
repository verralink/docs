title: Character Profiles

description: Character Profiles are the core of your VerraLink identity, tracking your stats, artisan professions, commissions, attendance, and DKP history.

---

## Overview
Your Character Profile is your personal dashboard in VerraLink. It represents your in-game character and serves as the hub for all your activity, progress, and contributions across Verra.  

Profiles connect to guilds, marketplaces, commissions, and activities, making them the foundation of the VerraLink experience.

---

## Character Details
Each profile displays your characterâ€™s:  
- **Level**  
- **Race, Archetypes, and Class**  
- **Main Stats**: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Mentality  
- **Attributes** such as Physical and Magical breakdowns  
- **Secondary Stats** (currently disabled and hidden until enabled in the future)  

You can update your character at any time using **OCR upload** for quick data entry.

---

## Artisan Professions
Your profile tracks all artisan professions across **Gathering, Processing, and Crafting**.  

- Professions are displayed with their current mastery level (Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, Grandmaster)  
- You can edit professions to stay current with your in-game progression  
- This data also powers your listings on the **Artisan Commission Board**  

---

## Attendance Logs
Your profile stores your full attendance history for any guild you are part of.  

- Displays events attended and missed  
- Tracks attendance type (template vs custom events)  
- Shows your **attendance rate** over time  
- Allows scheduling of **absences** so your guild knows when you will not be available  

Attendance is tied to guild activities, but the log is preserved on your profile so you always have a record of your participation.

---

## Commissions History
Commissions (formerly Tasks) are tracked in your profile, showing:  
- Submissions made to your guild  
- Approval or rejection status  
- Evidence attached to commissions  
- DKP or rewards earned  
- Pending or missed commissions  

This provides a full history of how you contribute to guild goals through commissions.

---

## DKP and Activity Points
Your profile maintains a **Points History** that shows:  
- Current DKP and Activity Points balance  
- DKP gained, spent, and net change over time  
- AP gained, spent, and net change over time  
- Detailed logs with timestamps for each transaction  

This makes DKP and AP fully transparent, giving you complete insight into your rewards and contributions.

---

## Marketplace and Commission Logs
Character Profiles also display your **marketplace history** (public and guild trades) and **commission history**, allowing you to track every trade or service you have participated in.

---

## Notes
- Character Profiles are updated automatically when you use the `/upload` command with OCR image recognition  
- Profiles serve as the bridge between your personal progression and your guild or community contributions  
- Attendance, commissions, and point history are guild-specific, but always stored in your profile for reference
