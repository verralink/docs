# Crafting Request System

The **Crafting Request System** allows guild members to request items to be crafted through a structured and transparent process that integrates with every part of the VerraLink platform.  

In this tutorial video, we explore how to create, approve, and fulfill crafting requests using the calculator, artisan tools, and guild management dashboard.

## How It Works

### 1. Request Creation
Members can open the **Request Item** page from the sidebar.  
After choosing an item and rarity, they can leave an optional comment or additional details.  

The system automatically imports material data from the **Crafting Calculator**, including splits, rarities, and quantities.  

### 2. Approval
Crafting Requests require staff or officer approval before becoming active.  
Once approved, the request enters the guild’s crafting queue and becomes visible to eligible artisans.

### 3. Breakdown and Fulfillment
When opened, the request shows a complete **component breakdown** for all required materials.  
Artisans can:
- Review material requirements  
- Reserve portions of the work  
- Submit progress or finished crafts  

### 4. Completion and Rewards
After completion, the request automatically logs DKP and Activity Points for contributing members.  
Guild officers can download an **Excel summary** of attendance, materials used, and completion details.
