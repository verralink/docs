description: Learn how to organize structured groups for raids and events using VerraLink's Party Management system, with automatic Discord announcements, role-based assignments, and integration with statics via Loadouts.
---

## Overview
Party Management allows officers to divide attendees into structured groups for raids, sieges, or other large-scale guild events. Members are assigned into parties based on their existing roles, making it easy to build balanced teams quickly and efficiently.

This system integrates seamlessly with the **Activities System**, ensuring that once members sign up for an activity, they can be placed into parties for that event. It also works closely with **Loadouts** (covered in a separate page), enabling officers to create recurring party structures (statics) that build long-term synergy.

## Quick Start

1. Create or select an activity from the **Activities page**  
2. Open the **Party Management tool** linked to that activity  
3. Assign members into parties based on their roles, levels, or availability  
4. Announce the finalized parties in the linked Discord channel  
5. Each member automatically receives a DM with their assigned party so they know exactly where to go and what to do  

## Usage

### Role-Based Assignments
- Members are assigned into parties based on their existing class and role data.  
- Officers can balance teams by ensuring each party has the right mix of Tanks, Healers, DPS, or Support.  

### Group Balancing
- Adjust class and role distribution across multiple parties.  
- Officers can drag and drop members into different parties as attendance changes.  

### Discord Announcements and DMs
- Finalized parties can be announced directly in the Discord channel tied to the activity.  
- Each member receives a **direct message** with their party assignment, ensuring there is no confusion about their role or placement.  

### Integration with Activities
- Party Management is directly linked to the Activities System.  
- As members join an activity, they are automatically available for party assignments.  

### Integration with Loadouts
- Loadouts allow officers to build **statics** â€” recurring, pre-defined party structures that can be reused across events.  
- Statics help build long-term synergy between members by keeping the same team compositions together.  
- Officers can design Loadouts based on role ratios, such as 2 Tanks, 4 DPS, and 2 Healers, and then assign members into these statics.   

### Flexibility
- Create as many parties as needed depending on guild size.  
- Supports both small raid groups and large-scale siege events.  

## Notes
- Party Management is designed to complement the **Activities System**, giving structure to planned events.  
- Announcements and automatic DMs help eliminate confusion by telling each member exactly where they belong.  
- Loadouts provide the ability to create **statics**, making recurring parties easy to manage and ensuring synergy across groups.  
- Parties can be saved, reused, and adjusted dynamically as guild needs evolve.
