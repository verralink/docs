## Overview
The Guild Management tools provide officers with full control over the guild’s roster, DKP system, statistics, and artisan lists. These features help keep your guild organized, transparent, and motivated to contribute.

## DKP Decay
To keep your DKP system fair and encourage ongoing participation, VerraLink supports **automatic DKP decay**. This prevents members from stockpiling points indefinitely and rewards active involvement.  
- Officers can configure the decay rate in guild settings  
- Decay can be applied across the entire guild or by activity type  
- Decay settings ensure DKP remains a dynamic and balanced currency  

## Member Management
- View all members and their profiles in one centralized dashboard  
- Track levels, classes, artisans, and contributions  
- Officers can update roles, permissions, and guild ranks  
- Members can be promoted, demoted, or removed as needed  

## Statistics
VerraLink provides data-driven insights into guild performance:  
- **Commission Statistics**: See which members are completing the most commissions and earning rewards  
- **Activity Statistics**: Track attendance, activity completion, and participation trends  
- **Artisan Leaderboard**: View top guild artisans by profession and level  
- **Artisan Lists**: Maintain an internal roster of all artisans, making it easy to find who can craft what  

## Notes
- DKP decay ensures fairness and activity over time  
- Commission and activity statistics provide transparency into contributions  
- Artisan tracking supports both internal coordination and guild-wide recognition
