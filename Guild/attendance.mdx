# Attendance System

## Overview

The Attendance System allows guilds to track participation in activities such as raids, sieges, and guild events. Attendance ties directly into DKP and Activity Points, rewarding members for consistent participation.

VerraLink uses **Activity Templates** that officers create and fully customize in **Guild Settings → Activities**. These templates make attendance simple, repeatable, and consistent across your guild’s events.

## Quick Start

1. Go to **Guild Settings → Activities**  

2. Create a new **Activity Template** by setting the name, description, DKP weight, and other options  

3. During the event type  

```
/attendance <DROP DOWN EVENT>
```

4. Members in the same voice channel are automatically logged  

5. The system checks that each member in the voice channel is an active member of your guild on the website  

- If they are not, they will receive a DM informing them they are not part of the guild and will be directed to your Discovery Page  

6. Each valid member receives a verification DM confirming their attendance  

7. The officer receives an access code via DM that can be shared with members who attended the event but were not in the voice channel  

8. An Excel export of the attendance list is provided automatically for record keeping  

## Usage

### Activity Verification

Each attendee receives a DM confirming the activity they have been credited for.  

If a member attended the event but was not in the voice channel, officers can share the generated access code with them to validate their attendance.

This feature is particularly useful for **spontaneous events**, where not all members may be gathered in a single voice channel. It complements the **Activities System**, which is the planned event management tool covered in another page.

### Voice Channel Attendance

The system mirrors your current voice channel and records all members present.  

Non guild members are filtered out and directed to your Discovery Page.

### Data Export

Attendance records are provided as an Excel file for manual tracking, auditing, or DKP system uploads.

### Profile and Stats Tracking

Attendance is automatically stored on the VerraLink website.  

Each member’s profile shows attendance history.  

A dedicated Attendance Page provides guild wide stats and participation summaries.

## Notes

Attendance is built on the **Activities system**, ensuring all events follow standardized templates.  

Exported Excel sheets include activity type, timestamp, and participants for easy archiving.  

Officers can track attendance trends across time for DKP, activity points, or custom rewards.
