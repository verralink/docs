title: Discord Commands

description: Learn the VerraLink Discord commands available to all players. Update your character privately, view profiles, and interact with guild activities directly through embeds.

---

## Overview
The VerraLink bot gives players direct access to their profiles, attendance, and guild activities through Discord. Commands are designed with privacy in mind, with sensitive data always delivered by DM.  

Embeds for activities and commissions also allow quick reactions and submissions without leaving Discord.

---

## Core Commands

### `/upload`
- Can be used in **any Discord** where the VerraLink bot is present  
- Privately prompts you in DM to update your character with an OCR upload  
- Ensures your profile is always accurate without exposing data publicly  

---

### `/characters`
- Sends a **private DM** with a list of all characters on your VerraLink profile  
- Displays their stats and data  
- Only you can see this information, ensuring privacy  

---

### `/profile`
- Shows the character you have linked to the **current guild server**  
- Only works if you are a member of that guild on VerraLink and the server is linked  
- Lets you quickly confirm your active guild character without leaving Discord

## Attendance Functions

### Attendance Embed
When a guild posts an activity, the bot creates an **attendance embed**. Members can react to indicate their status:  
- ✅ **Attending**  
- ❌ **Absent**  
- ❓ **Tentative**  

### Access Code Button
If you attended an activity but were not present in voice, officers may provide you with an **Access Code**.  
- Entering this code through the embed button gives you credit for the event  
- Ensures fairness for members who participated but could not join voice channels  

---

## Commissions Embeds
Guild commissions appear as embeds in Discord. From these embeds, you can:  
- View details of the commission  
- Open the submission form directly from the embed  
- Track your submission status  

This makes contributing to guild goals simple and seamless.

## Notes
- All sensitive commands return results in **private DMs** for security  
- Reacting to embeds is the fastest way to interact with guild activities  
- The access code system ensures all genuine participants can receive credit, even outside of voice attendance
