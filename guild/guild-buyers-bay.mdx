The Guild Buyers Bay functions similarly to the Public Buyers Bay but is restricted to guild members only.  

It allows guildmates to post requests for items, resources, or crafted goods they wish to purchase, creating a cooperative in-guild economy that supports crafting, raiding, and progression.
