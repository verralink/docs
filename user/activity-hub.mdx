# Activity Hub (Also known as the Home Page)

## Overview
The Activity Hub is your personal command center on VerraLink. It is part of the home page and is the main tab out of 3 tabs which showcase the latest Verralink News and Ashes of Creations News. It gathers every outstanding task, event, request, and listing related to all of your characters and shows them in a single unified dashboard.  

Instead of checking multiple pages such as commissions, marketplace listings, or activities, the Activity Hub brings everything together so you never miss something important.

## What the Hub Tracks

The Activity Hub automatically gathers information from every character on your account and displays:

### Uncompleted Commissions
These include commissions you have:
- Created and are waiting on  
- Submitted and are waiting for approval  
- Accepted but have not completed  

You can open any commission directly to view details, upload evidence, or complete the submission.

- Global Buyers Bay requests  
- Guild Buyers Bay requests  

You can:
- Edit your request  
- Cancel it  
- Check responses from sellers  
- Track the status of ongoing trades

### Items for Sale

### Crafting Requests

- Requests you opened  
- Requests where you are tagged  
- Requests waiting for your materials  
- Requests waiting for officer approval  

You can open each request to continue work or check progress.

---

### Notifications
Any high-priority notifications from:

- Attendance access codes  
- Recipe requests  
- Loadout assignments  
appear in the hub as actionable items until dismissed.

## Why It Matters
The Activity Hub eliminates the need to navigate several different systems to figure out what is pending.  
You gain a clear view of everything across all your characters, including:

- Tasks you owe  
- Requests you are waiting on  
- Events you need to attend  
- Listings or buy requests that require your attention  
- Submissions that officers have not yet approved  

This keeps you organized and ensures you never miss anything related to your guilds or marketplace activity.
