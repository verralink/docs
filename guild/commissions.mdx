## Overview
Guild Commissions (formerly called the Task System) provide a way for officers to post objectives for members to complete in order to contribute to the guild’s overall goals. By completing commissions, members earn **DKP** and **Activity Points**, reinforcing participation and engagement across the guild.

This system helps officers guide the guild’s progress while rewarding members for meaningful contributions.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the **Commissions** tab in your guild dashboard  
2. Click **Create Commission**  
3. Enter the details:  
   - **Name** of the commission  
   - Optional **banner image**  
   - **Description** of the objective  
   - **DKP value** and **Activity Point value**  
   - Frequency (One-time, Daily, Weekly, Monthly)  
   - Whether evidence is required  
   - Whether submissions are auto-approved or require officer review  
4. Post the commission and it will appear in the guild’s commission list  
5. Members can complete the commission and submit proof if required  
6. Officers approve submissions (unless auto-approval is enabled), awarding DKP and AP automatically  

## Usage

### Flexible Commission Types
- **One-time commissions** for unique guild needs  
- **Recurring commissions** (daily, weekly, monthly) for ongoing goals  
- Configurable requirements: evidence submission, auto-approval, or manual review  

### Rewards
- Members earn **DKP** for guild events and progression  
- Members earn **Activity Points** to track ongoing engagement  

### Officer Controls
- Decide how much DKP/AP each commission is worth  
- Require proof for accountability (screenshots, logs, etc.)  
- Enable auto-approval for routine commissions  

### Member Experience
- Members view available commissions in the guild dashboard  
- Submit proof when required  
- Earn rewards once their submission is approved or auto-approved  

## Notes
- Guild Commissions are designed to encourage **daily, weekly, and monthly engagement**.  
- Officers have full control over the design and approval process.  
- Commissions are a structured way to reward activity outside of scheduled events like raids or sieges.
