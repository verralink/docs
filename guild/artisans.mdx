The tracker lists **all members who have the recipe learned**, including:
- Member name with quick link to profile

- You can open a commission form from the recipe result to route work to the right artisan  
- Results link to **Artisan Overview** and **Character Profiles** for deeper inspection


## Permissions
- Viewing the tracker is available to guild members by default if your policy allows it
